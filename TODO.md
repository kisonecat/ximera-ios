XIMERA Tasks

These are lists of task in no particular order. Some of the tasks
appear in both lists, because there is a component needed in both
categories.

Conversion:

* Use wallpaper -- also have a (semi random) transparent mask at the edges... this will make it “glow”

* Enable searching

* correct size for interactive

* Wang tiles for background.... background that changes as you get deeper in to the text. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile
  Or - two sets of tiles, a 768x2048 base layer and a 768x2304 (mostly transparent detail layer) this will allow for 18 pages of no reptition background

* Make scripts “slice.rb” and “extract.rb” more friendly. (deposit tiles in the correct directory etc)

* Eventually, we may want to use the STIX fonts. 



Content Navigator:

* Add a “grippy” icon to the nav bar - *maybe* make the bar a brushed aluminum.

* Enable searching

* Give gauge for depth in text

* Make spine work ←Probably the most important

* Make table of contents

* Allow scanned work to be inserted

* sounds



Interactives:

* pull data from touch and display (llama and matrix)
* epsilon-delta definition of limit, with f(x) bouncing in between
* Delayed display. 
* Delayed display formulas with annotation and formulas morphing to next step
* screen capture (selective, rather than whole-page)
* avoid using graphics - rather use something that will teach the students to display by hand.
