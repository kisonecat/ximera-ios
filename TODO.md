XIMERA Tasks
============

These are lists of task that are somewhat in order of importance. Some of the tasks appear in both lists, because there is a component needed in both 
categories.

Conversion:
-----------
* Make scripts “slice.rb” and “extract.rb” more friendly, deposit tiles in the correct directory etc. We would like others to be able to use this process in the future
* Correct size for interactive. Currently the interactives are in a fixed size window.
* correct location for interactives. They should probably be centered on the screen by default. 
* Use wallpaper -- also have a (semi random) transparent mask at the edges... this will make it “glow.” We need this process to be somewhat flexable with respect to the resolution of the device. 
* Enable searching
* Eventually, we may want to use the STIX fonts. 
* ~~Wang tiles for background.... background that changes as you get deeper in to the text. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile~~
  ~~Or - two sets of tiles, a 768x2048 base layer and a 768x2304 (mostly transparent detail layer) this will allow for 18 pages of no reptition background~~

Content Navigator:
------------------
* Make navigation spine work.
* Make table of contents.
* a "navigation view" where we see each section next to the other
* Enable searching -- perhaps the "right" way to do this is by making a large 
  scrolling (spinning) list of keywords that someone could search for. This is 
  in contrast to the traditional search where one "types" in the word they are 
  searching for. This could be implemented by using the LaTeX \index tag. 
* Add a “grippy” icon to the nav bar - *maybe* make the bar a brushed aluminum.
* Allow scanned work to be inserted
* Give gauge for depth in text
* sounds
* screen capture (selective, rather than whole-page)
* flash cards for dfn's, named thms.
* glossery for dfn's named thms.


Interactives:
-------------
* pull data from touch and display (llama and matrix)
* epsilon-delta definition of limit, with f(x) bouncing in between
* Delayed display -- eg, if an example is given, we'd want the solution to "unfold"
* Delayed display formulas with annotation and formulas morphing to next step
* avoid using graphics - rather use something that will teach the students to display by hand.
* clicker/are you awake? button
* a "group" assigner
* movie whose rate is controled by a swipe (this is essentially a generic description for an interactive that could be used a lot)
* incorperate scanned work
* show inductive patterns, a truss of arbitrary length.
