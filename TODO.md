XIMERA Tasks
============

These are lists of task in no particular order. Some of the tasks
appear in both lists, because there is a component needed in both
categories.

Conversion:
-----------
* Enable searching
* correct size for interactive
* Make scripts “slice.rb” and “extract.rb” more friendly. (deposit tiles in the correct directory etc)
* Eventually, we may want to use the STIX fonts. 
* ~~Use wallpaper -- also have a (semi random) transparent mask at the edges... this will make it “glow”~~
* ~~Wang tiles for background.... background that changes as you get deeper in to the text. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_tile~~
  ~~Or - two sets of tiles, a 768x2048 base layer and a 768x2304 (mostly transparent detail layer) this will allow for 18 pages of no reptition background~~

Content Navigator:
------------------
* Add a “grippy” icon to the nav bar - *maybe* make the bar a brushed aluminum.
* Enable searching
* Give gauge for depth in text
* Make spine work ←Probably the most important
* Make table of contents
* Allow scanned work to be inserted
* sounds
* screen capture (selective, rather than whole-page)
* flash cards for dfn's, named thms
* glossery for dfn's named thms
* a "navigation view" where we see each section next to the other


Interactives:
-------------
* pull data from touch and display (llama and matrix)
* epsilon-delta definition of limit, with f(x) bouncing in between
* Delayed display -- eg, if an example is given, we'd want the solution to "unfold"
* Delayed display formulas with annotation and formulas morphing to next step
* avoid using graphics - rather use something that will teach the students to display by hand.
* clicker/are you awake? button
* a "group" assigner
* movie whose rate is controled by a swipe (this is essentially a generic description for an interactive that could be used a lot)
* incorperate scanned work
